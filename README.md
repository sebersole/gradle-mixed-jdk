# gradle-mixed-jdk

As the project name imples, this is a simple stand-alone project for me to test builds using multiple JDKs (well targetting more than one Java version).  The plan is to port what I learn and the plugins I develop to the Hibernate ORM build.

The project consists of 2 modules:
* java6-module - represents a module that is intended to be Java 6 compatible.
* java8-module - represents a module that is intended to be Java 8 compatible.
